### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Marc Schwering. My original background is Molecular Biotechnology. Throughout my career I have changed from wetlab, to data science, to software development. The past years I have built software for Bayer's Pharma R&D. Now I am working as a freelancer.

Apart from that I like sailing, travelling, Muay Thai, and in general DYI stuff. So, you might find some related repositories for that :)
